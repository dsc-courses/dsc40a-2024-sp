/*
The following CSS variables define the main, public API for styling JupyterLab.
These variables should be used by all plugins wherever possible. In other
words, plugins should not define custom colors, sizes, etc unless absolutely
necessary. This enables users to change the visual theme of JupyterLab
by changing these variables.

Many variables appear in an ordered sequence (0,1,2,3). These sequences
are designed to work well together, so for example, `--jp-border-color1` should
be used with `--jp-layout-color1`. The numbers have the following meanings:

* 0: super-primary, reserved for special emphasis
* 1: primary, most important under normal situations
* 2: secondary, next most important under normal situations
* 3: tertiary, next most important under normal situations

Throughout JupyterLab, we are mostly following principles from Google's
Material Design when selecting colors. We are not, however, following
all of MD as it is not optimized for dense, information rich UIs.

<p><strong>Takeaway</strong>: When data are MCAR and you impute with the mean:</p>
<ul>
<li>The mean of the imputed dataset is an <strong>unbiased estimator</strong> of the true mean.</li>
<li>The variance of the imputed dataset is smaller than the variance of the full dataset.<ul>
<li>Mean imputation tricks you into thinking your data are more reliable than they are!</li>

<li><p>When data are MAR, mean imputation leads to biased estimates of the mean across groups.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The bias may be different in different groups.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example: If the missingness depends on gender, then different genders will have differently-biased means.</li>
<li>The overall mean will be biased towards one group.</li>
</ul>

<li><p>Again, let's look at two distributions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The distribution of the <code>'child'</code> column in <code>heights</code>, where we have all the data.</li>

<li><strong>Improvement</strong>: Since MAR data are MCAR within each group, we can perform group-wise mean imputation.<ul>
<li>In our case, since the missingness of <code>'child'</code> is dependent on <code>'gender'</code>, we can impute separately for each <code>'gender'</code>.</li>
<li>For instance, if there is a missing <code>'child'</code> height for a <code>'female'</code> child, impute their height with the mean observed <code>'female'</code> height.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>With this technique, the overall mean remains unbiased, as do the within-group means.</p>

<li>Procedure:<ul>
<li>Apply probabilistic imputation multiple times, resulting in $m$ imputed datasets.</li>
<li>Compute statistics separately on the $m$ imputed datasets (e.g. compute the mean or correlation coefficient).</li>
<li>Plot the distribution of these statistics and create confidence intervals.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If a column is missing conditional on multiple columns, your "multiple imputations" should include probabilistic imputations for each!</li>
